# Snepsts AGS

Hi! I'm trying to make something dope but right now tbh it probably sucks. Here's where I store the source code for the thing that I want to be dope but probably sucks. Enjoy!

### Installation

`paru -S aylurs-gtk-shell`

Set up types:

`ags --init -c ~/.config/ags/config.js`

> NOTE: you might need a dummy config.js to generate the types. The types folder will go in this repo. I believe in you.

This is my custom implementation of ags to setup a cool, functional system UI. Intended to be used with Hyprland. Inspired by end-4's dotfiles.

TODO: Maybe only have .confg/ags have outputted files from ts project and have ts project live in a diff folder
